# IC-9700-Dual-Band-Digital-Operations

I recently discovered that it is possible to not only listen
to both selected bands on the Icom IC-9700 through the speakers
or a headset on the IC-9700, but one can also have instances
of WSJT-X or other digital decoding programs monitoring both
the main band and the sub band!

This document describes how to set it up.
